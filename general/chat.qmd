## How does it work?

The course AI is a chatbot that uses the [Dify](https://dify.byndsim.com/) platform hosted on Hetzner in Germany. If you have any questions about the course, feel free to ask the AI. Note, that the AI is not perfect and sometimes the answers might be incorrect. For more information about how the data is processed, please refer to the [privacy policy](privacy.qmd).
